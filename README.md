This project has two parts
1. analysis of NBA data

Research Backgrounds:
The NBA (National Basketball Association) is widely considered to be the premier men’s professional basketball league in the world. This project is trying to analyze NBA player data.

Dataset Description:
All of our data is from NBA China official website: https://www.basketball-reference.com/

Data Preparation:
I use python for doing Data Cleaning, Data analysis and Data Visualization. I used the code in the attachment to collect player information.

Mr. Lu has told me that there lacks connection between my project and IOT. And I found that there is an app called shottracker which is built based on the IOT. This app aims to analyze the player's shot zone so that they can find a better way to improve player's skills. However, I tried to use this way to collect the data, and I find there was others have done this before. I tried to collect the data as they do, however, the data of the shot zone is not accessible any more in the official site. I have no idea about the NBA data any more. So I decide to design another project, which is designed for the test.

2.Test machine

Description: We will build a question bank where the number of questions can be set freely. Then we will randomly select some questions from the questions in the question bank for each student participating in the exam. The students will complete the questions and finally the teacher will give students the score.

Inspiriation:Recently, I participated in the online written tests of some companies. I am curious whether their questions are the same for every testee. After checking the information on the Internet, I found that their questions were actually taken from the question bank, so I decided Use java programming to simulate a simple network test.

When searching for information on how to get NBA players 'shooting information, I found an article about how to get NBA players' shooting hot spots. But when I followed the method in the article to get the relevant data, I found that the NBA official website had turned off the relevant functions, so I couldn't get the relevant data.The link of the article is http://www.gregreda.com/2015/02/15/web-scraping-finding-the-api/.
