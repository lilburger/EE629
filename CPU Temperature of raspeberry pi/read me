Raspberry Pi temperature detection alarm

Description： My thought is to build a Raspberry Pi mailbox environment, and then read the CPU temperature through python, if it is higher than the specified temperature, send an email to the mobile phone mailbox to prompt.

Purpose：

Monitor hardware temperature and protect hardware security
Monitor whether the indoor temperature is too high in some ways.
