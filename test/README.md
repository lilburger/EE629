Test Machine

Description: We will build a question bank where the number of questions can be set freely. Then we will randomly select some questions from the questions in the question bank for each student participating in the exam. The students will complete the questions and finally the teacher will give students the score.

Inspiriation:Recently, I participated in the online written tests of some companies. I am curious whether their questions are the same for every testee. After checking the information on the Internet, I found that their questions were actually taken from the question bank, so I decided Use java programming to simulate a simple network test.
